def happy_mat(mat):


A Toeplitz matrix is a matrix where every left-to-right-descending diagonal has the same element. Given a non-empty matrix arr, write a function that returns true if and only if it is a Toeplitz matrix. The matrix can be any dimensions, not necessarily square.

For example,

[[1,2,3,4],
 [5,1,2,3],
 [6,5,1,2]]

is a Toeplitz matrix, so we should return true, while

[[1,2,3,4],
 [5,1,9,3],
 [6,5,1,2]]

isnâ€™t a Toeplitz matrix, so we should return false.

time complexity is O(n)
space is O(1)

  try to run the code


  you can traverse given matrix diagonaly

 probably that would be simpler. traversing diagonally. but thinking about how to do that
  would probably take up too much time for me right now
  ok your approch is also good but as th
 or rather let me try

 you think i should try diagonally or
  better the rabin karp one?
  if you are asking me then i'll prefer to go with diagonal because it take O(n)time and O(1) space complexity

  ok
  let me try to get the diagonal one

  algo
  start from the

  n = len(mat)
  start from the bottom left and go diagonal as long as there is an entry
    next diagonal is given by [row+1][col+1]. makes sense?
    if it makes sense I will go ahead and write the code


    ok right like that writ eit


 ok so
